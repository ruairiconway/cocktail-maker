## Brief
Thinkful Build - create an app that utilizes one or more APIs in an interesting way

## My Build
To create an app that provides users with cocktail recipes that match ingredients they already have + provide playlist suggestions from Spotify to help add some fun to the experience.

### Currently:
- The basic cocktail functionality is built
- I am awaiting an API key for the ability to use multiple ingredient searches. Currently 'create' can only search for one term via the base/free api provided.
- Still need to implement the spotify API.

### API reference
- The Cocktail DB - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
- Spotify - WIP
